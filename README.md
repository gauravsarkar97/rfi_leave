RFI-Leave Management System
This is a simple project done on Leave management system for employees during my 2 weeks vocational training at Information Technology Center at RFI, Govt. of India.
This project has been done using PHP as the backend programming language and frontend designs has been done using HTML5, CSS, jQuery.
Extensive code reuse has been done for the project due to the fact that such an application would require far more than just 2 weeks to complete(the whole app + its documentation) had we written the codes for all the modules from scratch.
It was locally hosted using an Apache Software called WAMPServer. The complete details about the project(both technical and non-technical) can be found in the PDF file named report_proj in the master branch.
